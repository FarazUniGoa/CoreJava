A daily learning log of Core Java topics, covering fundamental concepts, object-oriented programming, collections, multithreading, and advanced features. This repository showcases my consistent coding efforts, with well-documented examples and exercises for each topic.
<br><strong>Day 1</strong>: Object-Oriented Programming Basics
Implemented a Car class with fields, constructors, and encapsulation principles.
Learned how classes and objects form the foundation of OOP.
<br><strong>Day 2</strong>: Abstract Classes and Interfaces
Explored abstract classes and interfaces to demonstrate polymorphism.
Implemented a Shape hierarchy with Circle and Rectangle classes using abstraction.
<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: Explored inheritance concepts, implemented multilevel inheritance with Student and GraduateStudent classes, and demonstrated multiple inheritance using an interface Sports. Combined specialization and sports information to display a graduate student's complete profile.
<br><strong>Day 4</strong> : Implemented key OOP concepts including polymorphism, dynamic method dispatch, upcasting, and downcasting. Demonstrated runtime polymorphism using method overriding and type casting to access subclass-specific methods safely.
<br><strong>Day 5</strong> : Implemented a program to demonstrate access modifiers in Java. The BankAccount class uses private, protected, and public access levels to control access to account details, with methods to securely retrieve and display information. The MainRunner class extends BankAccount to showcase the use of protected members in subclasses and calls public methods to access private data securely.
<br><strong>Day 6</strong> : On Day 6, we explored the List Interface from the Java Collection Framework. We implemented a comprehensive Student Manager System with the following functionalities:
<li>Adding, displaying, and updating student records by name or ID.</li>
<li>Deleting student records using name or ID.</li>
<li>Fetching student details by ID and checking the total number of students.</li>
<li>This program demonstrated various methods of the List Interface and included dynamic user interaction with data manipulation.</li>
