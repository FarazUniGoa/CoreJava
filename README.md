A daily learning log of Core Java topics, covering fundamental concepts, object-oriented programming, collections, multithreading, and advanced features. This repository showcases my consistent coding efforts, with well-documented examples and exercises for each topic.
<br><strong>Day 1</strong>: Object-Oriented Programming Basics
Implemented a Car class with fields, constructors, and encapsulation principles.
Learned how classes and objects form the foundation of OOP.
<br><strong>Day 2</strong>: Abstract Classes and Interfaces
Explored abstract classes and interfaces to demonstrate polymorphism.
Implemented a Shape hierarchy with Circle and Rectangle classes using abstraction.
<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: Explored inheritance concepts, implemented multilevel inheritance with Student and GraduateStudent classes, and demonstrated multiple inheritance using an interface Sports. Combined specialization and sports information to display a graduate student's complete profile.
